
#*****  Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values  ************

# the equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables

# For example:-


a = 'Jibon ' # here a variable and  assign values is ' Jibon '
print(a)

a = 69
print(a)

b = 78.36
print(b,'\n')


#**********************    Multiple Assignment  *********************

# Python allows you to assign a single value to several variables simultaneously (একসঙ্গে /Together )

# For example:-

print('Multiple Assignment : ')
a = b = c = 1

print(a)
print(b)
print(c) # same output


# Another Example

print('Another Example Multiple Assignment ')
a,b,c = 1,2,"jibon"

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
