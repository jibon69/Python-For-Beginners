
#*****  Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values  ************

# the equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables

# For example:-

'''

a = 'Jibon ' # here a variable and  assign values is ' Jibon '

print(a)

'''

# Example

'''
a = 10; b = 20; c = 30;

print(a);

print(b);

print(c)

#**********************    Multiple Assignment  *********************

# Python allows you to assign a single value to several variables simultaneously (একসঙ্গে /Together )

# For example:-

'''
print('Multiple Assignment : ')
a = b = c = 1
print(a)
print(b)
print(c) # same output

'''

# Another Example

'''
print('Another Example Multiple Assignment ')

a,b,c = 1,2,"jibon"

print(a)

print(b)

print(c)

'''


# Example

'''

one = 1

two = 2

three = one + two

print(three)

# Example

hello = 'Hello'

word = "word"

print(hello+" "+word)
